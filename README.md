CMPT419Proj
===========

A classmate and I wrote some MATLAB code that would use TripAdvisor reviews to predict future popularity and attention. 
This set of scripts starts with the json files found at http://times.cs.uiuc.edu/~wang296/Data/ and results in a set of testing and training data. A more detailed description of the code and our process can be found in the pdf labelled 'CMPT419_Grp12_ProjectReport.pdf'.
