CMPT419Proj
===========

A classmate and I wrote some MATLAB code that would use TripAdvisor reviews to predict future popularity and attention. 
This set of scripts starts with the json files found at http://times.cs.uiuc.edu/~wang296/Data/ and results in a set of testing and training data. A more detailed description of the code and our process can be found in the pdf labelled 'CMPT419_Grp12_ProjectReport.pdf'. Json files were parsed using JSONlab (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33381-jsonlab--a-toolbox-to-encode-decode-json-files-in-matlab-octave).
Some of the directories show example of the data that was being processed.
